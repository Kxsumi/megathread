Do this first\n✔️ Recommended: Use Firefox + uBlock Origin.\nFirefox is the top non-Chromium browser, offering nice security and privacy features. It also boasts the best compatibility with uBlock Origin for effectively blocking ads and other harmful web content. ✔️ Recommended: Change your DNS settings.\nDNS can enhance the browsing experience by increasing speed and bypassing restrictions, as your ISP usually offers a slower default DNS that may censor websites. 🧲 For torrenting: Install a reputable torrent client such as qBittorrent.\nA torrent client is essential for downloading files via torrent files, which is distinct from direct downloads. 🧲 For torrenting: Set up a VPN network such as AirVPN or ProtonVPN.\nA VPN encrypts your connection and masks your IP address, making it ideal for torrenting and access to restricted content. 🧲 For torrenting: Bind the torrent client to the VPN interface.\nEnsures torrenting only happens when the VPN is active, lowering leak chances to essentially zero.

➜ Megathread / Quality Control\rQuick reminder\n⚖️ This section outlines the general conditions for updating the Megathread, whether it involves adding or removing links. We prioritize finding a balance between different factors to make informed decisions within our operational framework. 🎲 Quantity is not our primacy concern. The main focus lies in the meticulous curation of each entry. 📑 Privacy and security Devoid of malware Ensuring the utmost safety and security of websites and downloads is of utmost importance. Therefore it is absolutely imperative to eliminate any presence of malware. Any website that falls short in meeting this requirement will be promptly labeled as an unsafe site.\nHTTPS Encryption Websites need to make use of HTTPS encryption because it offers users privacy and security. Encrypting data serves as a shield against hackers, effectively concealing sensitive information. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in verifying the legitimacy of websites by utilizing digital certificates.\nNot located in the Five Eyes It is encouraged that websites be located beyond the realm of the Five Eyes alliance, which includes the United States. This ensures that they fall outside the jurisdiction where certain copyright laws, such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), cannot be fully enforced, or at all.\n📑 Quality of life Catalog size In order for websites to be truly effective, it is crucial that they provide users with a diverse range of options. By offering a wide array of choices, websites can cater to the varied needs and preferences of their users.\nFile hosting services To guarantee a seamless and user-friendly experience, websites that employ direct download methods should rely on trustworthy and dependable free file hosters, so users can access and download files without any complications.\nGraphical user interface It is important to offer a visually intuitive and interactive platform, enabling users to engage with the system in a more natural and user-friendly manner. Good design choices facilitate effortless navigation and enhance the efficiency of task execution for users.\nMinimal loading time Optimizing speed and catering to a diverse global audience is essential for websites. To achieve this, utilizing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is highly advantageous.\nUpdate frequency Keeping a website regularly updated with fresh content is essential to maintain user confidence and attractiveness. When a website lacks updates, it can create the impression of inactivity or financial instability.\nZero anti-adblock popups Ideally, websites should refrain from implementing anti-adblock measures, but users can easily use uBlock Origin to avoid encountering these annoyances. Additionally, if users come across any websites with such nuisances, they can report it to r/uBlockOrigin for efficient support.\n📑 Overall integrity Cross-references The authenticity of a website heavily depends on the general sentiment and plethora of experiences shared within numerous pirate-related communities, which can be found across a wide range of platforms, including both public and private trackers, as well as other indexes.\nOpen source Having the code freely available for all to see, like on platforms such as GitHub, is undeniably a great advantage. It adds a bonus to the overall trust of users when it comes to a website.\n🔗 Check Out More 📜 Return to Megathread","catalog-size#Catalog size":"","cross-references#Cross-references":"","devoid-of-malware#Devoid of malware":"","file-hosting-services#File hosting services":"","graphical-user-interface#Graphical user interface":"","https-encryption#HTTPS Encryption":"","minimal-loading-time#Minimal loading time":"","not-located-in-the-five-eyes#Not located in the Five Eyes":"","open-source#Open source":"","update-frequency#Update frequency":"","zero-anti-adblock-popups#Zero anti-adblock popups":""},"title":"Quality Control"},"/docs/guides/torrenting/":{"data":{"":"","android#Android":"Android Limitations\nThere are a number of downsides to torrenting on an Android device rather than a PC:\nPort forwarding generally not supported by VPN providers on Android. Inability to block file extensions. Many private trackers do not allow Android clients. Still, torrenting CAN be done safely with the following recommendations.","background-information#Background Information":"","bind-your-vpn-to-your-torrent-client-critical#Bind Your VPN to Your Torrent Client (critical)":"In qBittorrent, go to Tools \u003e Options \u003e Advanced Find the Network Interface setting and change it from “Any” to the option that matches your VPN. For Proton the option will be either “ProtonVPN” or “ProtonVPN TUN” depending on whether you are using OpenVPN or Wireguard (per THIS guide). If you aren’t sure which interface is correct, go to Control Panel \u003e Network and Internet \u003e Network Connections. Find the adapter that your VPN is using here and choose that name in qBit. If you still cannot determine which option is correct, try toggling your VPN off and on to see which option disappears / reappears from the qBit list. Restart qBittorrent.","bind-your-vpn-to-your-torrent-client-critical-1#Bind Your VPN to Your Torrent Client (critical)":"In Flud, go to Settings \u003e Privacy and Security Check the “VPN Only” box. Now in Flud, go to Settings \u003e Advanced Change the Network Interface from “Any” to the option that matches your VPN. If you cannot determine which option is correct, try toggling your VPN off and on to see which option disappears / reappears from the list.","choosing-a-vpn-provider#Choosing a VPN Provider":"There are literally hundreds of VPN providers to choose from, how do you know which to pick? Many factors come into consideration: price, speed, security (no-logs policy, based in country friendly to piracy), features (port forwarding, split tunneling). Right now my recommendation for a VPN provider for torrenting would be Proton Premium, but feel free to use your provider of choice (this guide will use Proton Premium as an example). FMHY’s VPN list offers some alternatives. Free VPN’s are not recommended for torrenting. Proton’s free plan DOES NOT SUPPORT torrenting.","exclude-problematic-file-extensions-optional-but-recommended#Exclude Problematic File Extensions (optional but recommended)":"In qBittorrent, go to Tools \u003e Options \u003e Downloads \u003e Excluded File Names In the excluded file names list in the qB settings add the extensions you want to exclude, ONE EXTENSION PER LINE. Put an asterisk (wildcard) before each extension. I would recommend blocking AT LEAST the following three extensions: *.lnk\r*.scr\r*.arj","installation#Installation":"Choose your VPN provider and install their application and sign in (download link for Proton). Choose a VPN server to connect to in the VPN application. Pick the closest server with the best ping. It is not necessary to choose a server in another country. If your provider has P2P specific servers (like Proton), then be sure to choose one of those. Install your torrent client (qBittorrent highly recommended and will be used throughout this guide).","installation-1#Installation":"Choose your VPN provider and install their application and sign in (download link for Proton).

If your provider has P2P specific servers (like Proton), then be sure to choose one of those. Install your torrent client (Flud highly recommended and will be used throughout this guide).","proper-vpn-setup#Proper VPN Setup":"Simply using a VPN is NOT sufficient to fully hide your IP address. There are many failure mechanisms that could leak your IP even when using a VPN. User error (forgot to turn VPN on, closed VPN before exiting torrent application). Momentary loss in VPN connection (VPN provider disconnect, local network problems, computer shutdown). ANY loss in VPN connection, no matter how short (fractions of a second) is enough to leak your home IP and get you a DMCA letter. Because of this, “binding” your VPN to your torrent client is required in order to completely eliminate the risk of IP leaks. WARNING: Kill Switches Kill switches are NOT sufficient to protect you. They are reactionary and any delay in killing the application/connection will lead to your IP leaking. Kill switches are not the same as binding your VPN. Kill switches will fail eventually and you will get caught.","set-up-port-forwarding-optional-but-recommended#Set up Port Forwarding (optional but recommended)":"Enable port forwarding in your VPN app and find your forwarded port number in your VPN client (Proton guide shown HERE) In qBittorrent, go to Tools \u003e Options \u003e Connections (Proton guide shown HERE). Uncheck the “Use UPnP / NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router” option. In the “Port used for incoming connections” field, enter the port number you found in your VPN app. Click OK when you’re done. To verify it’s working, after a few minutes you should see the small orange flame icon at the bottom of the qBittorrent window change into either a green plug or a green globe icon.","set-up-split-tunneling-optional-but-recommended#Set up Split Tunneling (optional but recommended)":"In your VPN application, enable the option for split tunneling (Proton guide shown HERE) In the Split Tunneling options, set qBittorrent to be “Included” in the VPN tunnel.

Use Firefox + uBlock Origin. Firefox is the top non-Chromium browser. Google has been making changes to neuter ad blocking capability on its Chrome browser, and these changes are expected to eventually take effect Chromium-based browsers as well. Firefox also has the best compatibility with uBlock Origin, an addon that is very efficient at blocking ads and redirects. UBO is currently the most effective ad blocker. Do not assume that other ad blockers are sufficient, often times they are not. Pirate sites are notorious for having malicious ads and redirects. Proper ad blocking is not simply a convenience, it is a NECESSITY for SAFETY. Choose a torrent site from FMHY’s Torrent Sites List. Heed warnings on FMHY specifically around software and games. These should only be sourced from a very specific subset of torrent options. Guide Verification\nThis guide was made by: LZ129Hindenburg","torrenting-risks#Torrenting Risks":"Torrenting is very different from direct downloads or streaming sites in that it operates on a peer-to-peer file sharing network. In order to be able to share with others peers on the network, your IP address becomes visible to anyone in the torrent swarm. In certain countries (Germany, USA, etc) there are specialized law firms that monitor and collect IP addresses participating in certain torrent swarms. These firms will send DMCA letters to the ISP who is responsible for that address, then the ISP will forward those letters to you. In Germany this can include demands for hundreds of euros in fines or face legal action. In the USA, this can result in temporary disruptions to your network connection, and eventually your ISP may cancel your service entirely.","vpn#VPN":"Because of the risks mentioned above, a VPN becomes necessary to hide your IP address when torrenting in those countries. A VPN routes your network traffic through a remote server, serving as a middle-man and hiding your home IP address. When you torrent with a VPN, the IP address exposed in the torrent swarm is that of the VPN server, not your home IP. Because of this, torrent activity cannot be traced back to you, and therefore you will not receive DMCA letters.","windows#Windows":""},"title":"Torrenting + VPN Guide"},"/docs/mobile/":{"data":{"--megathread--mobile#📱 ➜ Megathread / \u003cstrong\u003eMobile\u003c/strong\u003e":"","-accrescent#🔗 Accrescent":"","-acmarket#🔗 ACMarket":"","-advanced-google-play-search#🔍 Advanced Google Play Search":"","-akiyama#🔗 Akiyama":"","-an1#🔗 AN1":"","-androeed#🐐 Androeed":"","-android-republic#🔗 Android Republic":"","-anilab#🔗 Anilab":"","-anime--manga#📑 Anime \u0026amp; Manga":"","-anime-chicken#🔗 Anime Chicken":"","-aniyomi#🐐 Aniyomi":"","-apk-amp#🔗 APK Amp":"","-apk-editor-studio#🔗 APK Editor Studio":"","-apk-home#🔗 APK Home":"","-apk-mods-search#🔍 APK Mods Search":"","-apk-thing#🔗 APK Thing":"","-apkcombo#🔗 APKCombo":"","-apkdone#🔗 APKdone":"","-apkgit#🔗 APKGIT":"","-apkkit#🔗 APKKIT":"","-apkmb#🔗 APKMB":"","-apkmirror#🐐 APKMirror":"","-apkmodsapp#🔗 ApkModsApp":"","-apkmody#🔗 APKMODY":"","-apkmonk#🔗 apkmonk":"","-apkmos#🔗 ApkMos":"","-apkpure#🐐 APKPure":"","-apksum#🔗 APKSum":"","-apktoy#🔗 APKToy":"","-apkvision#🔗 ApkVision":"","-app-manager#🐐 App Manager":"","-appteka#🔗 Appteka":"","-audiorelay#🐐 AudioRelay":"","-auroraoss#🔗 AuroraOSS":"","-catalogue--stores#📑 Catalogue \u0026amp; Stores":"","-clipious#🔗 Clipious":"","-dlandroid#🔗 DlAndroid":"","-f-droid#🐐 F-Droid":"","-farsroid--persian-ui#🔗 farsroid • Persian UI":"","-gbox#🔗 Gbox":"","-grayjay#🔗 Grayjay":"","-gyawun#🐐 Gyawun":"","-harmony-music#🔗 Harmony Music":"","-hyperion#🔗 Hyperion":"","-ihackedit#🔗 iHackedit":"","-innertune#🔗 InnerTune":"","-kotatsu#🔗 Kotatsu":"","-let-me-downgrade#🔗 Let Me Downgrade":"","-libretube#🐐 LibreTube":"","-liteapks#🔗 LITEAPKS":"","-lucky-patcher#🐐 Lucky Patcher":"","-material-you#🔗 Material You":"","-mihon#🐐 Mihon":"","-mobilism#🔗 Mobilism":"","-modded#📑 Modded":"","-modyolo#🐐 MODYOLO":"","-music#📑 Music":"","-namida#🔗 Namida":"","-newpipe#🐐 NewPipe":"","-onyxbits#🔗 Onyxbits":"","-pano-scrobbler#🔗 Pano Scrobbler":"","-pdalife#🔗 PDALIFE":"","-platinmods--sign-up#🔗 Platinmods • Sign Up":"","-rb-mods#🔗 RB Mods":"","-releaseapk--sign-up#🔗 ReleaseAPK • Sign Up":"","-revanced#🐐 ReVanced":"","-revdl#🔗 Revdl":"","-rimusic#🐐 RiMusic":"","-sbenny#🔗 Sbenny":"","-seal#🔗 Seal":"","-search-engines#📑 Search Engines":"","-showappslike#🔍 ShowAppsLike":"","-simpmusic#🔗 SimpMusic":"","-skytube#🔗 SkyTube":"","-snaptube#🔗 Snaptube":"","-songtube#🔗 SongTube":"","-soundbound#🔗 Soundbound":"","-spmp#🔗 SpMp":"","-spowlo#🔗 Spowlo":"","-tubular#🐐 Tubular":"📱 ➜ Megathread / Mobile\rQuick reminder\n✔️ All links have been reviewed and approved by moderators, but proceed with caution. 👍🏻 Rather having an enormous variety, our Megathread provides only the finest options. 🐐 GOAT status = Highly regarded by the pirate community. 📑 Anime \u0026 Manga 🔗 Akiyama Open-source website and Android app that uses web scraping from AnimeFLV.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Anilab Safe and free anime streaming, ensuring the best experience for you.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Anime Chicken Groundbreaking app that transforms anime viewing into a delightful time.\nURL Safety Results 🐐 Aniyomi Enjoy anime, cartoons, series, effortlessly on your Android device.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Kotatsu Uuncomplicated and user-friendly manga viewer created by and for the community.\nURL Safety Results 🐐 Mihon Easily access manga, webcomics, and comics on your Android device.\nURL Safety Results 📑 Catalogue \u0026 Stores 🔗 Accrescent Modern, secure Android app store prioritizing user privacy, and developer accessibility.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 ACMarket Premier selection of altered, enhanced, cracked apps and games.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Appteka Cost-free Android market that grants access to a vast collection of free apps.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 AuroraOSS Alternate client for Google Play, allows users to download, update, and search for apps.\nURL Safety Results 🐐 F-Droid User-friendly platform for installing Free and Open Source Software applications.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Material You Design system with personalization, incorporating typography, color, icons, and more.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Onyxbits Serves as a hub for software distribution primarily targeting the Android operating system.\nURL Safety Results 📑 Modded 🔗 AN1 Latest versions of Android games and programs, ensuring optimal performance.\nURL Safety Results 🐐 Androeed Discover a wide range of games, APK hacks, and premium versions.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 Android Republic Advanced and exclusive Android mods since 2014, ensuring quality and growth.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 APK Home Premium, and Paid APK Apps \u0026 Games with just one click for free.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 APKdone Source for the latest in Android apps and tech news, covering a wide range of topics.\nURL Safety Results 🔗 APKKIT Secure smartphone software downloads globally.
