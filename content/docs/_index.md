**Not so fast sailor! Do this first**

- `✔️ Recommended`: Use [**Firefox**](https://www.firefox.com/) + [**uBlock Origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/).
  - Firefox is the top non-Chromium browser, offering nice security and privacy features. It also boasts the best compatibility with uBlock Origin for effectively blocking ads and other harmful web content.

- `✔️ Recommended`: Change your [**DNS**](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/dns/) settings.
  - DNS can enhance the browsing experience by increasing speed and bypassing restrictions, as your ISP usually offers a slower default DNS that may censor websites.

- `🧲 For torrenting`: Install a reputable torrent client such as [**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org/).
  - A torrent client is essential for downloading files via torrent files, which is distinct from direct downloads.

- `🧲 For torrenting`: Set up a VPN network such as [**AirVPN**](https://airvpn.org/) or [**ProtonVPN**](https://protonvpn.com/).
  - A VPN encrypts your connection and masks your IP address, making it ideal for torrenting and access to restricted content.

- `🧲 For torrenting`: [**Bind the torrent client**](https://protonvpn.com/support/bittorrent-vpn#how-to-bind-the-client-to-the-proton-vpn-interface) to the VPN interface.
  - Ensures torrenting only happens when the VPN is active, lowering leak chances to essentially zero. See our [Torrenting + VPN Guide](https://rentry.org/torrentvpn).
